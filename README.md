# Restaurant-Management-System
A python gui based application on RMS~Data Structure


# Libraries:

# tikinter:
Python has a lot of GUI frameworks, but Tkinter is the only framework that’s built into the Python standard library. Tkinter has several strengths. It’s cross-platform, so the same code works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Visual elements are rendered using native operating system elements, so applications built with Tkinter look like they belong on the platform where they’re run.

# from tkinter import tk:
The tkinter package (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface to the Tcl/Tk GUI toolkit. Both Tk and tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, including macOS, as well as on Windows systems.
# from tkinter import messagebox:
The tkinter.messagebox module provides a template base class as well as a variety of convenience methods for commonly used configurations. The message boxes are modal and will return a subset of (True, False, OK, None, Yes, No) based on the user’s selection.
# import random:
For integers, there is uniform selection from a range. For sequences, there is uniform selection of a random element, a function to generate a random permutation of a list in-place, and a function for random sampling without replacement.
# import time:
In Python, the time() function returns the number of seconds passed since epoch (the point where time begins).


# Project:
Just copy the code install these library and run the project a restaurant management system for data structure course made on python
